title: Deploying to mcp-use Cloud
description: Deploy your MCP server to mcp-use cloud with one command
---

This guide demonstrates how to deploy your MCP server to **mcp-use cloud**, the recommended deployment platform for mcp-use servers. With a single command, you can deploy your server and get a production-ready URL.

<Note>
**Recommended Deployment Method**

mcp-use cloud is the easiest and fastest way to deploy your MCP servers. It automatically handles:
- ✅ Container building and deployment
- ✅ Environment variable configuration
- ✅ Automatic MCP_URL setup
- ✅ HTTPS and custom domains
- ✅ Health checks and monitoring
- ✅ Zero configuration required
</Note>

## Prerequisites

1. **Node.js/Bun**: For building your MCP server
2. **mcp-use CLI**: Install the CLI package
3. **mcp-use Account**: Sign up at [mcp-use.com](https://mcp-use.com) or login via CLI

## Quick Deployment

Deploy your MCP server in one command:

```bash
# Install the CLI (if not already installed)
npm install -g @mcp-use/cli

# Login to mcp-use cloud
mcp-use login

# Deploy your server
mcp-use deploy
```

That's it! Your server will be built and deployed automatically.

### What happens during deployment

The deployment process automatically:
1. ✅ Detects your project type (Node.js or Python)
2. ✅ Packages your source code
3. ✅ Builds your application
4. ✅ Configures environment variables (including `MCP_URL`)
5. ✅ Deploys to cloud infrastructure
6. ✅ Provides a production URL

## Deployment Options

### Basic Deployment

```bash
# Deploy with default settings
mcp-use deploy
```

### Custom Deployment Name

```bash
# Deploy with a custom name
mcp-use deploy --name my-weather-server
```

### Custom Port

```bash
# Deploy with custom port (default: 3000)
mcp-use deploy --port 8000
```

### Custom Runtime

```bash
# Specify runtime explicitly (node or python)
mcp-use deploy --runtime node
```

### Open in Browser

```bash
# Automatically open deployment URL after success
mcp-use deploy --open
```

### Deploy from Local Source

```bash
# Force deployment from local source (even if GitHub repo detected)
mcp-use deploy --from-source
```

## GitHub Repository Deployment

If your project is a GitHub repository, `mcp-use deploy` will automatically detect it and offer to deploy from GitHub:

```bash
mcp-use deploy
```

You'll see:
```
GitHub repository detected:
  Repository: your-org/your-repo
  Branch:     main
  Commit:     abc1234

Deploy from GitHub repository your-org/your-repo? (y/n):
```

This approach:
- ✅ Deploys directly from your GitHub repository
- ✅ Automatically detects build and start commands
- ✅ Uses the latest commit from your branch
- ✅ No need to upload source code manually

## Local Source Deployment

If your project is not a GitHub repository, or you want to deploy from local source:

```bash
mcp-use deploy --from-source
```

The CLI will:
1. Package your local source code (excluding `node_modules`, `.git`, etc.)
2. Upload it to mcp-use cloud
3. Build and deploy your server

## Environment Variables

The `MCP_URL` environment variable is automatically set during deployment to your server's production URL. This ensures your widgets and resources use the correct base URL.

### Automatic MCP_URL Configuration

When you deploy, mcp-use cloud automatically:
- Sets `MCP_URL` to your deployment URL (e.g., `https://your-deployment-id.deploy.mcp-use.com`)
- Configures your server to use this URL for widget assets
- Ensures all widget HTML uses the correct base URL

### Custom Environment Variables

You can set custom environment variables through the mcp-use cloud dashboard or by including them in your deployment configuration.

## Deployment Configuration

The CLI automatically detects your project configuration:

### Detected Settings

- **Runtime**: Detected from `package.json` (Node.js) or `requirements.txt`/`pyproject.toml` (Python)
- **Port**: Defaults to 3000, can be overridden with `--port`
- **Build Command**: Detected from `package.json` scripts
- **Start Command**: Detected from `package.json` scripts or entry point

### Example Project Structure

```
my-mcp-server/
├── package.json          # Detects build/start commands
├── src/
│   └── index.ts         # Server entry point
├── resources/           # UI widgets (auto-registered)
│   └── weather.tsx
└── dist/               # Build output (excluded from upload)
```

## After Deployment

Once deployment completes, you'll receive:

### Deployment URLs

```
✓ Deployment successful!

🌐 MCP Server URL:
   https://your-deployment-id.deploy.mcp-use.com/mcp

🔍 Inspector URL:
   https://inspector.mcp-use.com/inspect?autoConnect=https://your-deployment-id.deploy.mcp-use.com/mcp
```

### Using Your Deployed Server

#### Connect from MCP Clients

Configure your MCP client to connect to your deployment:

```typescript
// Browser client
import { BrowserMCPClient } from "mcp-use";

const client = new BrowserMCPClient({
  mcpServers: {
    myServer: {
      url: "https://your-deployment-id.deploy.mcp-use.com/mcp",
      transport: "http",
    },
  },
});
```

#### Claude Desktop Configuration

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "my-server": {
      "url": "https://your-deployment-id.deploy.mcp-use.com/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

## Monitoring and Management

### View Deployment Status

```bash
# Check deployment status
mcp-use status <deployment-id>
```

### View Deployment Logs

Logs are automatically streamed during deployment. You can also view them in the mcp-use cloud dashboard.

### Update Deployment

To update your deployment, simply run `mcp-use deploy` again. The CLI will:
- Detect if you have an existing deployment
- Update it with your latest code
- Preserve your deployment URL

## Custom Domains

You can configure custom domains for your deployment through the mcp-use cloud dashboard. Once configured, your server will be accessible at your custom domain.

## Troubleshooting

### Deployment Fails

If deployment fails, check:
1. **Build Errors**: Review the build logs shown during deployment
2. **Missing Dependencies**: Ensure all dependencies are in `package.json` or `requirements.txt`
3. **Port Conflicts**: Verify your port configuration matches your server code
4. **Environment Variables**: Check that required environment variables are set

### Widgets Not Loading

If widgets aren't loading correctly:
1. **MCP_URL**: Verify `MCP_URL` is set correctly (automatically set during deployment)
2. **Base URL**: Check that your server code uses `process.env.MCP_URL` or passes `baseUrl` to `createMCPServer`
3. **Asset Paths**: Ensure widget assets are built and included in your deployment

### Health Check Failures

Your server should expose a health check endpoint. The default is `/healthz`, but you can configure it:

```typescript
// Add health check endpoint
server.get('/healthz', (req, res) => {
  res.json({ status: 'healthy' });
});
```

## Best Practices

### 1. Use GitHub Deployment

Deploying from GitHub repositories is recommended because:
- ✅ Automatic updates on push
- ✅ Version control integration
- ✅ No manual source uploads
- ✅ Better CI/CD integration

### 2. Set MCP_URL in Server Code

Even though `MCP_URL` is automatically set, explicitly use it in your server:

```typescript
import { createMCPServer } from 'mcp-use/server';

const server = createMCPServer('my-server', {
  version: '1.0.0',
  description: 'My MCP server',
  baseUrl: process.env.MCP_URL, // Use environment variable
});
```

### 3. Test Locally First

Before deploying, test your server locally:

```bash
# Build and test locally
mcp-use build
mcp-use start
```

### 4. Monitor Your Deployments

Regularly check your deployment status and logs to ensure everything is running smoothly.
