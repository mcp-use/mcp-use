<Warning>
**Sandbox execution is not yet supported in the TypeScript library.**

If you need sandbox functionality, please use the [Python version of mcp-use](/python/client/sandbox) which has full support for running MCP servers in a sandboxed cloud environment using E2B.

Support for TypeScript is planned for a future release. If you'd like to request this feature or track its progress, please open an issue on [GitHub](https://github.com/mcp-use/mcp-use).
</Warning>

## What is Sandbox Execution?

Sandbox execution allows you to run MCP servers in a secure, isolated cloud environment. This is useful when you want to run MCP servers without installing their dependencies locally.

The Python version of mcp-use currently supports this feature through E2B integration. Visit the [Python Sandbox documentation](/python/client/sandbox) to learn more.
