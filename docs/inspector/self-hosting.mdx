## Docker Deployment

### Using Docker Run

Deploy locally or on any Docker-compatible infrastructure:

```bash
docker run -d \
  --name mcp-inspector \
  -p 8080:8080 \
  -e NODE_ENV=production \
  mcpuse/inspector:latest
```

### Using Docker Compose

For more complex deployments with environment variables:

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  mcp-inspector:
    image: mcpuse/inspector:latest
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      - NODE_ENV=production
      - PORT=8080
    restart: unless-stopped
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "curl", "-f", "http://localhost:8080"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 10s
      retries: 3
```

### Environment Variables

<Note>
All configuration is optional. The inspector works out of the box with sensible defaults.
</Note>

| Variable | Default | Description |
|----------|---------|-------------|
| `NODE_ENV` | `production` | Node.js environment |
| `PORT` | `8080` | Port to run the inspector on |
| `HOST` | `0.0.0.0` | Host to bind to |
