### Tools Tab

The Tools tab displays all available tools from the MCP server. Each tool shows its name and description.

</Frame>

Select a tool to view its details and execute it. The right panel will show the tool's schema and an Execute button.

### Resources Tab

The Resources tab displays available resources from the MCP server. Resources are data sources the server can provide.

<Frame caption="Resources tab showing no resources available">
<img src="/images/inspector/resources-empty.png" alt="Resources tab interface showing empty state" />
</Frame>

Note: Linear MCP server doesn't expose any resources, so this tab shows "No resources available".

### Prompts Tab

The Prompts tab shows pre-configured prompts from the MCP server. You can select and execute prompts with parameters.

<Frame caption="Prompts tab showing no prompts available">
<img src="/images/inspector/prompts-empty.png" alt="Prompts tab interface showing empty state" />
</Frame>

Note: Linear MCP server doesn't provide any prompts, so this tab shows "No prompts available".

# Chat Tab

<Note>
The Chat feature uses a BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) model. Your API key is stored locally in your browser and never sent to our servers. All requests are made directly from your device to your LLM provider.
</Note>

The Chat tab provides an interactive interface to test the MCP server with an LLM. Configure your API key to start chatting.


### Chat Setup
