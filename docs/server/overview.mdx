At mcp-use we provide some utilities and dev tools for server creation that we found very handy while building servers.
This include several improvement to the original FastMCP implementation in the `python-sdk` and to `FastMCP2.0`, two other popular frameworks to
create MCP servers.

We tried to keep our modifications as lightweight as possible in order for you to be able to use our development tools also
with the other frameworks, this means that you will still be able to get a lot of value from using mcp-use even if you use them.


To install:
```bash
uv pip install mcp-use[server]
```

# Quick Started

## Create a server

You can create a server the same way you create it in the other frameworks

```python
from mcp_use import MCPServer

server = MCPServer(
    name="My MCP Server",
)
```

## Add tools

```python
from mcp_use import MCPServer

server = MCPServer(
    name="My MCP Server",
)

@server.tool()
def get_cat(name: str) -> str:
    return f"{name} cat"
```

## Run the server

```python
mcp = MCPServer("My MCP Server")

@mcp.tool
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    return f"Hello, {name}!"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run()
```

you will be greated with these terminal output when you run this file:

```bash
mcp-use Version: 1.3.10

Example Server
This is an example server with a simple echo tool.
Tools: 4 | Resources: 0 | Prompts: 0 | Tokens: 307

- Local:        http://localhost:8000
- Network:      http://192.168.1.241:8000
- Docs:         http://localhost:8000/docs
- Inspector:    http://localhost:8000/inspector
- OpenMCP:      http://localhost:8000/openmcp.json

```

You can see how this will return some interesting informations, lets break them down in the next section.

## Server Informations

```bash
mcp-use Version: 1.3.10

Example Server
This is an example server with a simple echo tool.
Tools: 4 | Resources: 0 | Prompts: 0 | Tokens: 307
```

This section contains:
* the version of `mcp-use` you are using to run the server.
* the name of the server
* the `description/instructions` of the server
* information about the available capabilities of the server along with an estimate of the tokens it will occupy.

## Server Endpoints

```bash
- Local:        http://localhost:8000
- Network:      http://192.168.1.241:8000
- Docs:         http://localhost:8000/docs
- Inspector:    http://localhost:8000/inspector
- OpenMCP:      http://localhost:8000/openmcp.json
```

When your server starts, it automatically exposes several endpoints for different use cases:

### **Primary MCP Endpoint**

#### `/mcp` - MCP Protocol Endpoint
The main endpoint where MCP clients connect to interact with your server.

**Usage:**
- **Local**: `http://localhost:8000/mcp`
- **Network**: `http://192.168.1.241:8000/mcp`

This endpoint handles all MCP protocol communication including:
- Server initialization and capability negotiation
- Tool discovery and execution
- Resource listing and retrieval
- Prompt management
- Real-time streaming and notifications

**Transport Types:**
- **HTTP Streaming**: Default transport for web-based clients
- **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**: For real-time updates
- **STDIO**: For local transport.

### **Development Endpoints**

<Tip>
Development endpoints are only available when `dev_mode=True` is set in your server configuration.
</Tip>

#### `/docs` - Interactive API Documentation
A comprehensive, interactive documentation interface powered by mcp-use's automatic OpenMCP generation.

**Features:**
- **Tool Testing**: Test your MCP tools directly in the browser with a user-friendly interface
- **Schema Exploration**: View detailed JSON schemas for all tools, resources, and prompts
- **Request/Response Examples**: See example payloads and responses
- **Authentication Testing**: Test different authentication methods if configured

**Use Cases:**
- Rapid prototyping and testing during development
- Debugging tool parameters and return values
- Sharing API documentation with team members
- Client integration testing

#### `/inspector` - MCP Protocol Inspector
A real-time debugging interface that visualizes MCP protocol messages as they flow between clients and your server.

**Features:**
- **Live Message Monitoring**: See all incoming and outgoing MCP messages in real-time
- **Message Filtering**: Filter by message type (initialize, tools/list, tools/call, etc.)
- **Payload Inspection**: Detailed view of JSON-RPC message structure
- **Performance Metrics**: Response times and message frequency
- **Error Tracking**: Highlight failed requests and error responses

**Use Cases:**
- Debugging client-server communication issues
- Understanding MCP protocol flow
- Performance optimization
- Integration testing with different MCP clients

#### `/openmcp.json` - Server Metadata
A JSON endpoint that provides comprehensive metadata about your server in the OpenMCP format.

**Response Structure:**
```json
{
  "openmcp": "1.0",
  "info": {
    "title": "Example Server",
    "version": "0.1.0",
    "description": "This is an example server with a simple echo tool."
  },
  "capabilities": {
    "tools": { "listChanged": false },
    "resources": { "subscribe": false, "listChanged": false },
    "prompts": { "listChanged": false }
  },
  "tools": [...],
  "resources": [...],
  "prompts": [...]
}
```

**Use Cases:**
- **Client Discovery**: Allow MCP clients to discover your server capabilities
- **Schema Validation**: Validate your server's tool and resource schemas
- **Integration Testing**: Programmatically inspect server metadata
- **Documentation Generation**: Generate client-side documentation from server metadata

### **Network Access**

#### Local vs Network URLs
- **Local (`localhost:8000`)**:
  - Accessible only from your development machine
  - Faster connection with lower latency
  - Ideal for development and testing

- **Network (`192.168.1.241:8000`)**:
  - Accessible from any device on your local network
  - Perfect for testing on mobile devices, tablets, or other computers
  - Enables collaborative development and demo scenarios
  - IP address automatically detected from your network interface

<Warning>
Network endpoints expose your server to your local network. Ensure you trust all devices on your network when using network access.
</Warning>

### **Endpoint Configuration**

You can customize endpoint behavior through server settings:

```python
server = MCPServer(
    name="My Server",
    dev_mode=True,  # Enable development endpoints
    settings=ServerSettings(
        host="0.0.0.0",  # Bind to all interfaces for network access
        port=8000,       # Custom port
    )
)
```

**Available Settings:**
- `host`: Network interface to bind to (`"127.0.0.1"` for local only, `"0.0.0.0"` for all interfaces)
- `port`: Port number (default: 8000)
- `dev_mode`: Enable/disable development endpoints (default: False)

## Development Features

### **Auto-Reload**
Use the `mcp-use run` command to automatically restart your server when files change:

```bash
mcp-use run server.py --reload
```

When you save changes to your server file, you'll see:
```bash
ðŸ”„ Server reloaded due to file changes
