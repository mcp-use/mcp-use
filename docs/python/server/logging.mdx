# MCP-Specific Logging

<Card title="" img="./images/Logging.jpg" horizontal="true"/>

<Info>
mcp-use provides informative logging about which MCP endpoints are hit, making it easy to understand server activity and debug issues.

## What is MCP-Specific Logging?

MCP-specific logging provides detailed information about which MCP endpoints are being accessed, including the specific endpoint name and request details.

## Why Use MCP-Specific Logging?

This type of logging is super useful because:
- **Clear visibility** into which MCP endpoints are being hit
- **Easy debugging** of MCP protocol interactions
- **Request tracking** with endpoint names and status codes
- **Better understanding** of server usage patterns
- **Token usage visibility** - approximate display of tokens your server occupies in the model's context window

## Example Log Output

<img src="./images/Logging.jpg" alt="MCP endpoint logging example" />

As you can see, the logs clearly show which MCP endpoints are being accessed, such as:
- `[initialize]` - Server initialization
- `[tools/list]` - Listing available tools
- `[tools/call:echone]` - Calling a specific tool
- `[resources/list]` - Listing available resources
- `[ping]` - Health check requests

The logs also display approximate token counts (e.g., "Tokens: 214") to give you visibility into how much context your server uses. This addresses a common criticism of MCP servers occupying too much of the model's context window.

This makes it much easier to understand what's happening with your MCP server and debug any issues.
