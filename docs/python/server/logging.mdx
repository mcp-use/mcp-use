<Info>
mcp-use provides informative logging about which MCP endpoints are hit, making it easy to understand server activity and debug issues.

MCP-specific logging provides detailed information about which MCP endpoints are being accessed, including the specific endpoint name and request details.

## Why Use MCP-Specific Logging?

This type of logging is super useful because:
- **Clear visibility** into which MCP endpoints are being hit
- **Easy debugging** of MCP protocol interactions
- **Request tracking** with session IDs, endpoint names and status codes
- **Better understanding** of server usage patterns
- **Token usage visibility** - approximate display of tokens your server occupies in the model's context window

### Understanding the Log Format

Each log line contains detailed information about the request:

```
INFO: 127.0.0.1:58478 - "POST /mcp [b98ed3729a6443e4875d3f0db151881e] [tools/call:search] HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
```

Breaking down each component:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Log Level">
    <code style={{color: '#10b981'}}>INFO:</code> - The severity level of the log message
  </Step>

  <Step title="Client Address">
    <code style={{color: '#3b82f6'}}>127.0.0.1:58478</code> - The IP address and port of the client making the request
  </Step>

  <Step title="HTTP Method">
    <code style={{color: '#f59e0b'}}>POST</code> - The HTTP method used for the request
  </Step>

  <Step title="Endpoint">
    <code style={{color: '#8b5cf6'}}>/mcp</code> - The MCP server endpoint path
  </Step>

  <Step title="Session ID">
    <code style={{color: '#ec4899'}}>[b98ed3729a6443e4875d3f0db151881e]</code> - Unique session identifier for tracking related requests
  </Step>

  <Step title="MCP Method">
    <code style={{color: '#06b6d4'}}>[tools/call:search]</code> - The specific MCP method being called (e.g., tools/call, resources/list, etc.)
  </Step>

  <Step title="HTTP Version">
    <code style={{color: '#64748b'}}>HTTP/1.1</code> - The HTTP protocol version
  </Step>

  <Step title="Status Code">
    <code style={{color: '#10b981'}}>200 OK</code> - The HTTP response status code
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Common MCP Methods

As you can see, the logs clearly show which MCP endpoints are being accessed, such as:
- `[6b3ce920...] [initialize]` - Server initialization with session ID
- `[6b3ce920...] [tools/list]` - Listing available tools
- `[6b3ce920...] [tools/call:echone]` - Calling a specific tool
- `[6b3ce920...] [resources/list]` - Listing available resources
- `[6b3ce920...] [ping]` - Health check requests

The logs also display approximate token counts (e.g., "Tokens: 214") to give you visibility into how much context your server uses. This addresses a common criticism of MCP servers occupying too much of the model's context window.

This makes it much easier to understand what's happening with your MCP server and debug any issues.
