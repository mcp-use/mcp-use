# Inspector UI

<Card title="" img="./images/mcp_use_inspector.gif" horizontal="true"/>

<Info>
The mcp-use server framework includes a built-in Inspector UI, a web-based interface for real-time monitoring, debugging, and interaction with your MCP server. It provides a quick way to see server status, available tools, resources, and logs.
</Info>

## What is the Inspector UI?

The Inspector UI is a built-in web interface that provides real-time monitoring and debugging capabilities for your MCP server. It's a visual dashboard that shows server status, available tools, resources, and logs. It also includes a BYOK (Bring Your Own Key) chat interface for interactive communication with your MCP server.

## Why Use the Inspector UI?

The Inspector UI makes it easier to:
- **Debug issues** by seeing real-time logs and server status
- **Test tools** interactively without writing client code
- **Monitor performance** with live metrics and request tracking
- **Explore capabilities** by browsing available tools and resources
- **Chat with your server** using the built-in BYOK chat interface

<Warning>
The Inspector UI is only available when the server is running in **debug mode**. It is automatically disabled in production for security reasons.
</Warning>

## Accessing the Inspector

Once your mcp-use server is running in debug mode, you can access the Inspector UI by navigating to the `/inspector` endpoint in your web browser.

For a server running on `http://localhost:3001`, the Inspector will be available at:
`http://localhost:3001/inspector`

## Configuration

The Inspector UI is automatically enabled when running in debug mode and disabled in production. Configuration details will be documented once the implementation is complete.
