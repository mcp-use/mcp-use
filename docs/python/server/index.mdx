# Server Framework

<Info>
The mcp-use server framework extends the official MCP Python SDK with enhanced features for building production-ready MCP servers. It provides built-in documentation endpoints, inspector UI, improved logging, and seamless integration with the mcp-use ecosystem.

## Why mcp-use Server Framework?

While the [official MCP Python SDK](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/python-sdk) provides the core functionality for building MCP servers, mcp-use enhances it with:

  <Card title="Official SDK Compatibility" icon="check" href="/python/server/compatibility" img="./images/MCP.jpg">
    Fully compatible with the official MCP Python SDK. Extends existing functionality without breaking changes, ensuring seamless migration.

  <Card title="Inspector UI" icon="monitor" href="/python/server/inspector" img="./images/Inspector.jpg">
    Built-in web interface for real-time server monitoring, tool exploration, and debugging. Accessible at /inspector endpoint.

  <Card title="MCP-Specific Logging" icon="activity" href="/python/server/logging" img="./images/Logging.jpg">
    Enhanced logging system designed specifically for MCP servers with structured output, request tracing, and performance metrics.

## Compatibility

### Official MCP SDK
mcp-use server framework is **fully compatible** with the official MCP Python SDK. It extends the SDK rather than replacing it, ensuring:

- All official MCP features work as expected
- Existing MCP servers can be easily migrated
- Full compliance with MCP protocol specifications

### fastmcp2
mcp-use complements fastmcp2 by providing:

- **Different Focus**: fastmcp2 focuses on rapid prototyping, mcp-use focuses on production features
- **Enhanced Observability**: Better logging, metrics, and debugging tools
- **Ecosystem Integration**: Native compatibility with mcp-use clients and agents
- **Documentation**: Built-in API documentation and inspector UI

You can use both frameworks in the same project if needed.

## Quick Start

Create your first MCP server with mcp-use:

```python
from mcp_use.server import MCPServer

# Create a server instance
server = MCPServer(
    name="my-awesome-server",
    version="1.0.0",
    description="An awesome MCP server built with mcp-use"
)

# Define a tool
@server.tool()
def greet(name: str) -> str:
    """Greet someone with a personalized message."""
    return f"Hello, {name}! Welcome to mcp-use!"

# Define a resource
@server.resource()
def get_config() -> dict:
    """Get server configuration."""
    return {
        "name": server.name,
        "version": server.version,
        "features": ["tools", "resources", "docs", "inspector"]
    }

# Start the server
if __name__ == "__main__":
    server.run(port=3001)
```
