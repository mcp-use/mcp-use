Migrate the client stack to the official MCP TypeScript SDK v2 (`@modelcontextprotocol/client@2.0.0-beta.2`).

- `@mcp-use/client` now depends on `@modelcontextprotocol/client` instead of `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`, and is ESM-only (Node 20+). All connectors, sessions, OAuth, and the React `useMcp` hook were ported to the v2 API surface (method-string handlers, `SdkHttpError`/`SdkError`, `OAuthError`, `Headers`, `client/stdio` subpath).
- Automatic protocol negotiation: HTTP connections default to `versionNegotiation: "auto"` (probe with `server/discover`, transparently falling back to the 2025 `initialize` handshake against v1 servers); stdio defaults to the SDK's v1 mode. The negotiated generation/version is exposed on the connection and `useMcp` result as `protocolEra: "legacy" | "modern"` and `protocolVersion`.
- OAuth: consolidated `OAuthError`, issuer-stamp round-tripping, `discoveryState()` / `saveDiscoveryState()`, and `iss` validation on the callback (SEP-2352 / RFC 9207).
- The root `@mcp-use/client` export now selects a browser-safe HTTP implementation outside Node and a Node-enabled implementation under Node. `@mcp-use/client/browser`, `@mcp-use/client/auth`, and `@mcp-use/client/auth/node` were removed; use the root `MCPClient`, `createOAuthProvider`, and React entry instead.
- Breaking: the Node root entry no longer re-exports `BrowserOAuthClientProvider`, `BrowserOAuthOptions`, or `onMcpAuthorization` (those pull browser/`localStorage` code into the Node graph). Import them from `@mcp-use/client` in a browser bundler (default export condition) or from `@mcp-use/client/react` for the callback helper.
- `MCPClient.connect()` / `createSession()` auto-provisions OAuth for HTTP servers (via the entry’s `createOAuthProvider`) when no bearer/`authProvider` is set, completes the 401 → consent dance, and retries. Pass `oauth` options or `oauth: false` on the server config; `authProvider` remains an escape hatch. The CLI connect path uses this instead of hand-wiring `NodeOAuthClientProvider`.
- Breaking: removed v1 aliases (`samplingCallback`, `elicitationCallback`, `auth_token`, `customHeaders`, `clientConfig`, `debug`, `BrowserTelemetry`, and `ResourceTemplate`). Use `onSampling`, `onElicitation`, `authToken`, `headers`, `clientInfo`, `logLevel`, `Telemetry`, and `ResourceTemplateType`.
- Dependency slimming: removed `posthog-js` / `posthog-node` in favor of a `fetch`-only PostHog capture (no SDK), and dropped `@modelcontextprotocol/ext-apps` (a single MIME-type constant was inlined). `@mcp-use/client` now has a single runtime dependency (`@modelcontextprotocol/client`).
- All v2 packages now use `@modelcontextprotocol/client@2.0.0-beta.3`; `@mcp-use/agent` no longer carries the unused v1 `@modelcontextprotocol/sdk`.
- Runtime verification now covers Node, Deno, browser, and React against real v1 and v2 servers. Browser fetch is explicitly bound, Deno logging does not require env permission, and `useMcp` reaches `ready` only after normalized metadata is populated.
- Client examples now run against a four-server matrix (official SDK stateful v1/stateless v2 plus mcp-use v1/v2 servers with MCP Apps) and cover notifications, roots, sampling, elicitation, completion, capability negotiation, OAuth, and rendered widgets. HTTP/stdio config now forwards initial roots, SDK client options, default request options, and HTTP connection timeouts to connectors.
- Fixed legacy Streamable HTTP reverse RPC and notifications: streaming responses are no longer consumed by request logging, and sampling/elicitation use the active request transport. The v2 client auto-opens list-change subscriptions and preserves progress across MRTR retry rounds.
- `McpClientProvider` now propagates negotiated v1/v2 metadata, auth state, resource templates, and reverse-request queues consistently. Its configured display label is now `displayName`; `name` remains the negotiated server identity.
- React connections are HTTP-only, reconnect automatically, suppress console logging, and wait for explicit OAuth authentication by default. `viewSupport: true` advertises MCP Apps support without hand-writing extension capabilities.
- OAuth and transport proxies now preserve the upstream MCP URL as the SDK resource identity. Removed metadata/resource rewrite shims and gateway-derived OAuth URLs; MCP and OAuth bytes use separate injected fetch adapters.
- Browser OAuth supports CIMD through `clientMetadataUrl`, keeps DCR as SDK-managed compatibility fallback, stores credentials per authorization-server issuer, and rejects browser client secrets.
- The Inspector OAuth BFF now binds requests to SDK-discovered metadata/endpoints, fails closed on SSRF/private targets and redirects, caps bodies/timeouts, strips unsafe headers, and restricts CORS origins.
- Breaking: `@mcp-use/client` is ESM-only and no longer re-exports Zod `*Schema` constants (use `isSpecType` / `specTypeSchemas`). The exported `telFetch` is now a plain non-throwing `fetch` wrapper `(url, init) => Promise<void>` (previously a PostHog `fetch` override). Removed the vendored `JSONSchemaToZod` helper — use Zod 4's native `z.fromJSONSchema()` instead.
- The inspector and CLI were updated to consume the v2 client; the CLI gains a `--negotiate` flag on `client connect`. The CLI binary is now ESM (`dist/index.js`) since `@mcp-use/client` is ESM-only (`npx mcp-use` is unaffected).
- Internal `@mcp-use/client` src layout reorganized into semantic folders (`transport/`, flat root client API, `code-mode/`, slim `auth/`, collapsed `react/`); public package exports (`.` and `./react`) and symbol names are unchanged.
