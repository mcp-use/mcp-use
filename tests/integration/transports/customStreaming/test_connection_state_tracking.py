Test for GitHub Issue #120: Connection State Not Properly Tracked After SSE Disconnection

This test specifically validates that:
1. Connection state is properly tracked when SSE connections are closed by the server
2. Auto-reconnection works when connections are lost
3. Clear error messages are provided when tools are called on disconnected sessions
4. The is_connected property accurately reflects the actual connection state
